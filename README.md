# SeanAmmirati.github.io
Stats Works and Data Science Blog

A blog powered by Pelican that shows projects from my stats-works repository as well as some additional articles/projects I have been working on. 

To host this locally, clone the master branch, and install pelican:

`git clone https://github.com/SeanAmmirati/SeanAmmirati.github.io.git`

`pip install pelican`

and run the following command in the root directory of the repo 

`pelican -l`

This will run a local version of the website at localhost:8000. 

The website is also available at [seanammirati.github.io](https://seanammirati.github.io).
